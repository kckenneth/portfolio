This is my portfolio on data science (DS), machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) skills and projects that are worthy of mention not because of just a mere project, but because of extra miles I spent on optimizing, troubleshooting and detailing every steps of the way I made to make the program work. Some can be applied in real life applications with continual efforts and several expertise from different domains to make a product such as IoT, Alexa, Google mini, Google assistant, etc etc.
